It give a sequence of n numbers using the fibonacci manner

For example given the number 6, the next number in the sequence will be 9 and the sequence continues.

To shed light on that, the value on a number is the sum of the two values that come before it.


Consider the sequence:

		d, t, p, l, p


		p = d + t and l = t + p and so on and so forth


The corresponding tests use unittest and can be tested by using nose tests.
